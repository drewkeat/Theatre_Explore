# Project Requirements
- Provide a CLI
- CLI application must provide access to data from a web page.
- Data provided must go at least one level deep.
    - A "level" is where a user can make a choice and then get detailed information about their choice. 
- Should not be too similar to the Ruby final projects (Music Library CLI, Tic-Tac-Toe with AI, Student Scraper).
- Use good OO design patterns. 
- Create a collection of objects, not hashes, to store your data. 
    - Pro Tip: Avoid scraping data more than once per web page - utilize objects you have already created. It will speed up your program!

- Additional Items:
    - Record 30 minutes of coding
    - Record video walkthrough of final app
    - Create blog and blog entry

## Checklist

### README file contains the following sections:
- A short description
- Install instructions
- A contributor's guide
- A link to the license for your code
### CLI Essentials
- Have a CLI for interfacing with the application
- Pull data from an external source
- Implement both list and detail views. The data provided must go at least one level deep.
- The application is pretty DRY
### Ruby Essentials
- Basic control flow - how "if" statements work
- Variable scopes - method, instance and class
- Object instantiation - #new (and possibly #initialize)
- The meaning of the "self" keyword
- Method types - class vs. instance methods
- Method return types - knowing what methods return
- Iterating through collections - at least using #each with a block
